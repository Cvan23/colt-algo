# H1 What is a linked list?

A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.
Linked Lists consist of **nodes**, and each node has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or null

## H2 A Linked List contains no indices

[Singly Linked Lists](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/singly-linked-lists#/3)

Like a train car; A Linked List is a bunch of nodes connected together.
We have node list before for traverseing the DOM

## H2 Comparisons with Arrays

**Lists**
- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

**Arrays**
-  Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be costly *time*
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
